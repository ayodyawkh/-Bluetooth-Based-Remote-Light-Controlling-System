# Bluetooth-Based-Remote-Light-Controlling-System
This is a project we did for the EN1070 Electronic Product Design and Manufacture Module. Here we designed a light controlling system which uses bluetooth as the controlling method. 
Our project is very helpful to disabled people because they don't have to walk to the light bulb to turn ON/OFF them.
